There are many environmental effects that can take a toll on homeless people. For example, during the winter time or cold seasons homeless people do not have a place to stay. Most of them also do not have the proper clothing to protect them from the cold weather. They do not have sweater or even blankets! That is yet another reasom why it is important to donate these types of things to shelters or the less fortunate. In addition, being exposed to very cold tempurates for a long period of time can have major health effects on people. If it were to rain, a homeless person would have to sleep in the rain and would most likely end up getting sick. Due to the fact that the homeless populatuon is increasing, more and more people can be affected. This means that germs and bactetria could spread causing more people to get sick.
