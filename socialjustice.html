There are many reasons why people are homeless. For example, the person could suffer from a mental illness, which could lead to them not being able to attain a job. Therefore, they are unable to make enough money for the average costs of living. Another example could be that the person is a veteran. This case is very unfortunate! There are many cases where veterans return from the war and are unable to get a job and pay for there daily expenses. In addition, a lot of jobs require a higher education. However, attaining a higher education costs a lot of money, which most people can not necessarily afford.
