As time progesses, the homeless population increases! For example, the homeless population in the 1980's was a lot less than it is now in 2019. However, the average costs of living have also increased in a major way. Therefore, the average costs of living is dramatically more than is was back then and it is much more difficult for people to support their families. This is very unfortunate but a differance can be made by making more affordable housing available to people that need it.
